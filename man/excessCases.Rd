\usage{
excessCases(ds, sub.statevar = "none", statevar = "state",
  agevar = "none", datevar, use.syndromes, denom.var, flu.import = T,
  rsv.import = T, adj.flu = F, adj.rsv = F, flu.var = "flu.var",
  rsv.var = "rsv.var", time.res = "day", extrapolation.date)
}
\arguments{
\item{ds}{A dataframe, with a format similar to the one produced by the ts_format() function. There should be a row for each date (week or day), and location (e.g. state, county),
and age category. There must be a column for date (YYYY-MM-DD), age category, location, and the number of counts for each of 
the selected syndromes. There should also be a column with a denominator (e.g., total number of ED visits). If there is no denominator, create a vector of 1s.}

\item{sub.statevar}{A string. Which variable in the input data frame contains the local geography identifier (e.g., county, borough)}

\item{statevar}{A string. Which variable in the input data frame contains the state (2-digit state; e.g. 'NY')?}

\item{agevar}{A string. Which variable in the input data frame contains the age group? Use 'none'
if there is no age grouping in the data}

\item{datevar}{A string. Which variables in the input data frame contains the date?}

\item{use.syndromes}{A vector with the variable names for syndromes to be tested (e.g., c('ILI','respiratory') ).}

\item{denom.var}{Which variable on the input dataframe should be used as the denominator. For instance, all ED visits. If there is no denominator, use a vector of 1s}

\item{flu.import}{A logical scalar. Import the latest influenza testing data from the CDC NREVSS system? If TRUE, the data will be downloaded and merge with the input 
dataframe by state and week. the flu variable will be included in the regressionwhen fitting the baseline}

\item{rsv.import}{A logical scalar. Import weekly search volume for 'RSV' for the states in the input dataframe? This option can only be used if there are 5 or fewer states on the input dataset. This variable is included in the regression model when fitting the seasonal baseline.}

\item{adj.flu}{A logical scalar. Adjust for influenza when fitting the seasonal baseline? This is automatically set to TRUE
if flu.import is TRUE}

\item{adj.rsv}{A logical scalar. Adjust for RSV when fitting the seasonal baseline? This is automatically set to TRUE when
rsv.import is TRUE}

\item{flu.var}{A string. If an influenza variabke is included on the input dataset, provide the variable name here.}

\item{rsv.var}{A string. If an RSV variable is included on the input dataset, provide the variable name here.}

\item{time.res}{One of \code{c("day", "week", "month")}. What is the data
binned by?}

\item{extrapolation.date}{The model is fit up to this date, and then extrapolated for all future dates.}
}
\value{
A list of lists with an entry for each syndrome, and sub-lists by age group and geography 
date: vector of dates used in the model. Use the helper function excessExtract to pull out specific components and organize them into an array
y: array of observed values for the syndromes
resid1 :Observed/model fitted values
upi: upper 95% prediction interval of the fitted value
lpi: lower 95% prediction interval of the fitted value
sqrt.rsv: RSV variale used in the model (if any)
log.flu: flu variable used in the model (if any)
unexplained.cases: observed-expected(fitted)
denom: denominator used in the model
}
\description{
\code{excessCases} This function takes a time series of cases (daily or weekly) and fits a harmonic baseline
There is also an option to import influenza data from the CDC's NREVSS database and match it by state,
or import Google search queries for RSV for the respective state. Dummy variables adjust for variations in average
incidence between years, and interactions between RSV or flu allow these effects to vary over time.

\details{
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION, THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE: This is a generic
function: methods can be defined for it directly or via the
\code{\link{Summary}} group generic. For this to work properly, the
arguments \code{...} should be unnamed, and dispatch is on the first
argument.
